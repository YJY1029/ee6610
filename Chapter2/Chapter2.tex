After an introduction on the development history and a brief on design criteria, this chapter goes deeper into reviewing design methodologies of MCM. For the rest of this chapter, the analysis of MCM will focus on specific components. Through the explanations for key methodologies, a detailed view on MCM design will be given. 

\section{Performance Parameters} 



\section{Package Style}

The package style refers to the macro arrangement for the whole MCM, determining the existances of specific conponents. Classical choices of package styles include 

assembly techniques (surface mount, chip and wire) 9.11 p.11 \cite{chen2006vlsi} 

\section{Wiring}

conductor materials: 9.9 p.220. \cite{chen2006vlsi}

wiring design: 8.6 p.338. \cite{tummala2001fundamentals}

chip and wire assembly

\section{Substrate}

The whole chapter 9 \cite{chen2006vlsi}

Substrate is another critical factor in MCM design. 

C: thick-film, HTCC, LTCC. D: inorganic dielectrics on Si, organic dielectric on Si. L: laminated board

substrate technologies (how to carry dies) 9.10 p.220 \cite{chen2006vlsi}
